                Yes, I'm a <strong>Chelsea</strong> fan. Since when? I don't even
                remember. All I know is that when I was little I've always
                supported the "blue-jersey" guys. And now I'm here. Having a panic
                attacks every couple of days. I've been through a lot so If you'll
                ever consider being mean to me (by denying my job application for
                example) remember this.
